Welcome! I am Vignesh, work at Apple on AI/ML. I spealize in leading Artificial Intelligence initiatives blending foundational core technology development and user experiences. I have been responsible for several important inflection points in infusing multimodal ML workstreams into the Apple Ecosystem

**Today,** I lead three fantastic teams that focus on visual generation, retreival / reasoning & AI Safety. Our north star is to influence user experiences through state of the art AI. 

**Apple Intelligence,** has been a primary area of focus for my teams over the past few years. We have a diverse set of focus areas including model pre-training, post-training, opitmization, alignment, indexing & reasoning. We interface with a variety of partner teams cutting across disciplines in service of user experiences.

**Joining Apple** as a Research Engineer in 2014, I had the opportunity to be part of the core team that laid the foundations for on-device ML in the company. Our initial efforts on enabling face recognition and scene analysis evolved alongside the infrastructure for efficient on-device inference. Over the next several years, our teams worked on architecting core ML workstreams for Camera and Photos products. 

**From 2019 onwards,** I have been focussing a lot more on systemwide intelligence. Live Text, Visual Lookup, Live Stickers, Communication Safety, Child Safety and Accesibility are among the experiences we focussed on. I am especially proud of our work on image captioning that we shipped in 2020. It was the best in class on-device captioner, and laid the foundations for infrastructure that supported efficient inference of transformers. This gradually led to dedicated efforts on efficient transformer inference, their use in photographic styles, and eventually to the work on on-device diffusion models.
