Hi, I am Vignesh Jagadeesh and work as a senior research manager at Apple. I have been with Apple since 2014, and have been part of the SIML (previously CVML) team for the entire duration.

Initial Years:
<p> When I joined the company, it was a time when there was a resurgance in neural networks / deep learning. While there were investments being made around the industry in server side deep learning, our team had a focus on "on-device" deep learning learning. My initial projects were around face analysis and recognition technologies. At around the same time, there was an effort towards on device scene classification. I decided to take on scene classification as my primary project and began building a small team around the effort in early 2016 </p>
