Hi, I am Vignesh Jagadeesh and work as a senior research manager at Apple leading several Apple Intelligence initiatives. I am a member of the SIML team in Apple's software organization.

<h3>Current Focus Areas</h3>
My team currently focusses on three primary areas: Content Understanding, Image Synthesis and Safety. Our projects are at the intersection between Vision and Lanugage, with an emphasis on building out ML infrastructure whereever needed. 

<h3>Initial Years</h3>
<p> When I joined the company, it was a time when there was a resurgance in neural networks / deep learning. While there were investments being made around the industry in server side deep learning, our focus was on "on-device" deep learning. My initial projects were around face analysis and recognition technologies. I subsequently transitioned to take on scene understanding as my primary focus area and began leading teams around the effort from 2016 onwards </p>
